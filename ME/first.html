                <h2>ABOUT ME :)</h2>
                <p>HI, I come from Udaipur(Rajasthan) in India a.k.a <i>"The city of lakes".</i> I am a fun, creative individual who strives for excellence in everything, I do. I have an utmost goal <b> creating seemingly everlasting things or resources that refuse to fade away </b> (want to contribute to people and leave the world a better place), which will be achieved by enhancing my technical skills in my college journey. 
                </p>
